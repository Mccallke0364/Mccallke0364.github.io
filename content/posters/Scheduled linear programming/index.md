##### Abstract
Math Department Scheduling Using Linear Programming
Annabelle Piotrowski, Katherine McCallum, Dr. Abra Brisbin
Scheduling classes is a challenging and time-consuming task. The mathematical technique of linear
programming has the potential to simplify this challenge, by building a model of linear constraints to find the most
optimal solution that satisfies all the constraints. In this project, we are implementing a linear programming model
using the Cplex library in Python. The objective function represents instructor satisfaction with different courses
and the constraints represent limitations such as the fact that one instructor cannot teach two courses at the
same time. These constraints allow many ways to build a schedule. The goal of our program is to identify the
most optimal solution, that maximizes the professor's satisfaction and class availability. Our model can
successfully use binary variables to assign professors to classes at specific times during the week on a small
scale. We will present a system for encoding the preferences about class times and constraints about maximum
and minimum numbers of credits and classes, as well as a method of visualizing the resulting schedules. We will
also present preliminary results from an alternative method of encoding combinations of courses, times, and
professors, using meeting patterns instead of individual days of the week.
